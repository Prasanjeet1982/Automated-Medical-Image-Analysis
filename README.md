# Medical Image Segmentation with FastAPI and Deep Learning

This repository contains an example of a medical image segmentation application using FastAPI and a pre-trained DeepLabv3+ model. The application allows you to upload medical images and receive segmented masks as a response.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-image-segmentation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd medical-image-segmentation
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. To run the FastAPI application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. To perform image segmentation, send a POST request with an image file to `http://localhost:8000/segment`. The application will respond with the segmented mask.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the FastAPI application code.
  - `main.py`: Defines the FastAPI routes and endpoints.
  - `segmentation.py`: Implements image segmentation using a pre-trained model.
  - `model.py`: Loads and initializes the pre-trained DeepLabv3+ model.
- `train.py`: A script to train the model on custom data.
- `run_app.py`: A script to run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`.
- `Dockerfile`: A Dockerfile to containerize the application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
